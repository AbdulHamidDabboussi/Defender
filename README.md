### Description of the Project
In the project we are going to implement classic arcade game "Defender".
Our aim is to create this game using the principles of object oriented programming.
The game is implemented in Java by using JavaFX library.

### Description of the Defender:
General:
It is a single player game, where a user has a control of their spaceship. Player's objection is to kill all aliens that will appear on the map

#### Maps:
The spaceship will be moving from left to right, and the map will represent a space where a user fights aliens.

#### Controls:
Each player has 4 different keys to control the movement of their spaceship and one key to fire. Up/ Down key to move forward/back, left/right key to move to the left/right and space bar for shooting. The direction of fire will depend on the last movement key used.

#### Gameplay:
Each time the alien successfully shoots the user's spaceship, user will loose one unit of health. In the beginning of each game, user will have 3 health units. The player will die if his spaceship is shot and he doesn't have any health units left. The bullets of spaship go in a straight line until they hit an object (alien).
